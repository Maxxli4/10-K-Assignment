# 10-K-Assignment
Programming Task for Summer Research

I was unable to complete the full asignment but I was able to make a simple inference based on Item 1: Business, Item 1A: Risk Factors, and Item 7: Management Discussion by extracting the 10-K files and just processing those sections.
I believed these sections would allow me to make the best inference as analyzing Business Facts helps investors and stakeholders understand the company's core business activities, its position within the industry, and its growth prospects. Analyzing Risk Factors helps investors assess the company's risk profile and the potential impact of various risk factors on its performance and valuation. Analyzing MD&A helps investors evaluate management's transparency, communication, and strategic decision-making, providing valuable insights into the company's future prospects.

I also attemped to parse the Earnings-per-share and Net Income for each year and predict what it would be in the future as they provide valuable insight into how a company is doing but I encountered parsing problems.

Python: I chose Python due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive libraries for data processing and web development.

Sec-Edgar-Tools: I used Sec-Edgar-Tools to retrieve Sec-Data from 1995 to 2023 and get Item 1, Item 1A, and Item 7

Pandas: I used pandas for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is used for processing and analyzing the data retrieved from the SEC filings.
